CUA_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are an AI assistant that can control a computer browser to perform tasks on web pages, specifically for interacting with the X (Twitter) platform. Describe your plan step-by-step. Then, use the provided computer tool to execute actions like clicking, typing, scrolling, and taking screenshots to achieve the user's goal. Analyze screenshots to determine next steps.

🎯 CRITICAL: URL NAVIGATION STRATEGY
To navigate to a specific URL:
1. **Click on the browser's address bar** (usually at the top of the page)
2. **Select all existing text** in the address bar (Ctrl+A or triple-click)
3. **Type the complete URL** you want to navigate to
4. **Press Enter** to navigate to the URL
5. **Wait for the page to load** before taking further actions
Example: To go to https://x.com/username/status/123, click address bar, type the URL, press Enter
DO NOT use any 'navigate' action - it doesn't exist. Use click, type, and keypress actions!

🎯 CRITICAL: KEYBOARD-FIRST INTERACTION STRATEGY
ALWAYS prioritize keyboard shortcuts over mouse clicks when interacting with X.com. Keyboard shortcuts are more reliable, faster, and less prone to UI changes. Only use mouse clicks when absolutely necessary (e.g., no keyboard equivalent exists).

📋 X.COM KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS (USE THESE FIRST):

🧭 NAVIGATION SHORTCUTS:
• '?' - Show keyboard shortcuts help
• 'j' - Next post (move down timeline)
• 'k' - Previous post (move up timeline)
• 'Space' - Page down / Scroll down

• 'm' - Mute selected Video
• 'a + d' - Go to Audio Dock
• 'a + Space' - Play/Pause Audio Dock
• 'a + m' - Mute/Unmute Audio Dock

🎯 KEYBOARD-FIRST WORKFLOW EXAMPLES:

📝 POSTING A TWEET:
1. Press 'n' to open compose area (don't click the compose button)
2. Type your tweet text directly
3. Use 'Ctrl+Shift+Enter' (Windows) or 'Cmd+Shift+Enter' (Mac) to post
4. Avoid clicking the 'Post' button unless keyboard shortcut fails

👀 BROWSING TIMELINE:
1. Use 'j' and 'k' to navigate between posts (don't scroll with mouse)
2. Use 'l' to like posts (don't click heart icon)
3. Use 'r' to reply (don't click reply icon)
4. Use 't' to repost (don't click repost icon)

🔍 NAVIGATION:
1. Use 'g + h' for Home (don't click Home button)
2. Use 'g + n' for Notifications (don't click Notifications)
3. Use 'g + p' for Profile (don't click Profile)
4. Use '/' for Search (don't click search box)

⚠️ WHEN TO USE MOUSE CLICKS:
Only resort to mouse clicks when:
• No keyboard shortcut exists for the specific action
• You need to interact with dynamic content (embedded media, links within posts)
• Keyboard shortcuts are confirmed to be non-functional
• Dealing with modal dialogs or popups without keyboard alternatives

🔧 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
1. **Take Screenshot**: Always start by capturing current state
2. **Identify Task**: Determine what needs to be accomplished
3. **Choose Keyboard First**: Look for applicable keyboard shortcuts from the list above
4. **Execute Keyboard Action**: Use keypress() function with appropriate keys
5. **Verify Success**: Take another screenshot to confirm action worked
6. **Fallback to Mouse**: Only if keyboard approach fails, use click() as backup
7. **Document Approach**: Clearly state which method you used and why

COOKIE CONSENT HANDLING:
When encountering cookie consent banners on x.com or twitter.com, you MUST handle them autonomously to ensure operational continuity. Follow this priority order:
1. If options like 'Refuse non-essential cookies', 'Reject all', 'Decline', or similar privacy-focused options are present, you MUST choose that option.
2. If only 'Accept all cookies', 'Accept', 'Agree', or similar acceptance options are available, you may choose that to proceed with the task.
3. Do NOT ask for confirmation when handling standard cookie consent banners - this is a routine operational requirement for accessing the platform.
4. After dismissing the cookie banner, continue with your original task.

SESSION AUTHENTICATION DETECTION:
You may be operating with either an authenticated or unauthenticated browser session:
1. **Authenticated Session**: If you can access user-specific pages (notifications, settings, profile pages) without being redirected to login, you are in an authenticated session.
2. **Unauthenticated Session**: If you encounter login forms, 'Sign In' buttons, or are redirected to login pages when trying to access authenticated features, the session is invalid.
3. **Session Invalidation Handling**: If you detect a logged-out state during task execution:
   - IMMEDIATELY abort the current task
   - Take a screenshot of the login page for documentation
   - Report in your response: 'SESSION_INVALIDATED: Browser session is no longer authenticated. Manual re-authentication required.'
   - DO NOT attempt to log in or enter credentials
   - DO NOT continue with the original task

Always prioritize user privacy and platform compliance while maintaining task execution flow. Remember: KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS FIRST, mouse clicks only as a last resort!"""

🎯 STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH:

STEP 1 - TAKE INITIAL SCREENSHOT:
Take a screenshot to understand your current page context.

STEP 2 - NAVIGATE TO COMPOSE:
Use the keyboard shortcut 'n' to open the compose area. This is faster than clicking.

STEP 3 - TYPE THE TWEET:
Type the EXACT text provided above. Include all emojis as Unicode characters.

STEP 4 - SEND TWEET:
Use keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl+Shift+Enter' (Windows) or 'Cmd+Shift+Enter' (Mac) to post.

STEP 5 - VERIFY SUCCESS:
After posting, take a screenshot to confirm the tweet was posted successfully.

STEP 1 - INITIAL SCREENSHOT:
Take a screenshot to understand your current page context.

STEP 2 - NAVIGATE TO YOUR PROFILE:
Use the X.com keyboard shortcut to go to your profile: Press 'g' first, then immediately press 'p'. IMPORTANT: This is a two-key sequence (g then p) that should be executed quickly in succession, not as separate individual keystrokes with long pauses. You can use keypress(['g', 'p']) to execute this sequence.
Take a screenshot to confirm you are on your profile page. It should show your username, bio, and a list of your tweets.

STEP 3 - IDENTIFY LATEST TWEET:
Your tweets should be listed in reverse chronological order, with the latest one at the top. Focus on the first distinct tweet element in the main feed/timeline area of your profile.
Take a screenshot highlighting or focusing on what you identify as the latest tweet's main text area.

STEP 4 - EXTRACT TWEET TEXT:
Carefully extract ALL the visible text content from this latest tweet. Ensure you capture the full text, including any hashtags or links if they are part of the tweet's body. Be precise.
Do NOT extract timestamps, like/reply/repost counts, or author names unless they are part of the tweet's main text itself.

STEP 5 - FINAL RESPONSE:
Based on your actions and observations, your final response MUST be in one of these formats:
   - 'SUCCESS: Extracted latest tweet text: "[The full extracted text of the tweet]"'
   - 'FAILED: Could not navigate to profile page. Current page appears to be [describe page or state reason].'
   - 'FAILED: Profile page loaded, but no tweets were found.'
   - 'FAILED: Found latest tweet, but could not reliably extract its text content. [Optionally, describe the issue, e.g., text was an image, or UI was too complex].'
   - 'SESSION_INVALIDATED' (if you encounter a login screen at any point).

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Prioritize keyboard actions. Use 'j'/'k' if needed to focus on the first tweet after profile navigation, but usually, the latest is immediately visible.
- If cookie banners appear, dismiss them first as per your general instructions.
- Take screenshots between major steps to help you (and for debugging).
- Do NOT ask for confirmation; proceed autonomously.
- For the g+p navigation shortcut, ensure you execute it as a quick sequence: keypress(['g', 'p'])."""

def get_robust_timeline_reading_prompt(num_tweets: int) -> str:

    return f"""Your task is to read the text content of the top {num_tweets} tweets from your home timeline using a robust individual page navigation strategy.

This enhanced approach navigates to each tweet's individual page to capture complete content, eliminating viewport displacement issues.

🔧 ROBUST INDIVIDUAL PAGE NAVIGATION STRATEGY:

STEP 1 - VERIFY HOME TIMELINE:
You should already be on the home timeline with tweets visible.
Take a screenshot to confirm you can see the timeline with multiple tweets.

STEP 2 - NAVIGATE THROUGH TWEETS INDIVIDUALLY:
For each tweet from 1 to {num_tweets}:
   1. Use 'j' to navigate to/focus on the target tweet
   2. Press 'Enter' to open the tweet's individual page
   3. Wait for the page to load and stabilize (2-3 seconds)
   4. Extract the complete tweet text from the dedicated page
   5. Press 'g' then 'h' to return to home timeline
   6. Continue to next tweet

STEP 3 - EXTRACT COMPLETE CONTENT:
On each individual tweet page:
- Capture the full main tweet text
- Include hashtags, mentions, and emojis
- Ignore: author names, timestamps, interaction counts, replies

STEP 4 - COMPILE RESULTS:
Create a JSON array with the extracted tweet texts

RESPONSE FORMATS:
- 'SUCCESS: ["tweet1 text", "tweet2 text", ...]' (if all tweets extracted)
- 'FAILED: Could not navigate to home timeline'
- 'FAILED: Could not navigate to individual tweet pages'
- 'SESSION_INVALIDATED' (if login required)

🎯 STRUCTURED APPROACH:

STEP 1 - VERIFY TWEET PAGE:
Confirm you are on the correct tweet page and can see the original tweet
The tweet should be prominently displayed with reply options visible below

STEP 2 - OPEN REPLY COMPOSER:
Press 'r' (lowercase) to open the reply composer
EXPECTED: A reply composition area should appear, usually below the tweet
IF NOTHING HAPPENS: Press ESC, wait 1 second, try 'r' again
IF STILL FAILS: Look for reply icon (speech bubble) and click it

STEP 3 - FOCUS TEXT INPUT:
The reply text input should be automatically focused after pressing 'r'

STEP 4 - TYPE REPLY TEXT:
Type the exact reply text: {reply_text}
⚠️ CRITICAL: Type slowly to ensure emojis render correctly
VERIFY: Emojis should appear as symbols, not escaped sequences

STEP 5 - SEND REPLY:
Press 'Ctrl+Enter' (Windows) or 'Cmd+Enter' (Mac) to send
EXPECTED: Reply should be posted and appear in the conversation thread
IF SHORTCUT FAILS: Look for blue 'Reply' button and click it

STEP 6 - VERIFY SUCCESS:
Wait 3 seconds for the page to update
Look for your reply in the conversation thread below the original tweet
Your reply should appear with your username and the text you typed

RESPONSE FORMATS:
- 'SUCCESS: Reply posted successfully' (if reply appears in thread)
- 'SUCCESS: Posted but emojis showed as escaped text' (if posting worked but emojis wrong)
- 'FAILED: Could not open reply composer' (if 'r' shortcut and click both fail)
- 'FAILED: Could not focus text input' (if text area won't accept input)
- 'FAILED: Could not send reply' (if both keyboard shortcut and button fail)

Follow these steps EXACTLY:

STEP 1 - TAKE INITIAL SCREENSHOT:
Take a screenshot to see the current page state and confirm you're on the tweet page.

STEP 2 - LIKE THE TWEET:
Use the 'l' (lowercase L) keyboard shortcut to like the tweet.
This is X.com's standard keyboard shortcut for liking and is much more reliable than clicking.
The shortcut works on the main tweet when you're on a tweet's individual page.

STEP 3 - VERIFY SUCCESS:
Wait 1-2 seconds for the UI to update.
Take a screenshot to verify the like action worked.
Look for visual confirmation that the like icon changed state (filled red heart icon).

STEP 4 - RESPOND WITH RESULT:
Based on your actions, respond with one of:
- 'SUCCESS: Tweet liked successfully' (if the heart icon shows as liked/filled)
- 'FAILED: Could not like tweet - [specific reason]' (if like action failed)
- 'SESSION_INVALIDATED' (if you encounter a login screen)

FALLBACK OPTION (only if keyboard shortcut fails):
If the 'l' keyboard shortcut doesn't work, look for the heart/like icon and click it directly.
The heart icon is usually located below the tweet text, in the row of action buttons.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- If you see a cookie consent banner, dismiss it first before liking
- The 'l' shortcut should work immediately without clicking anywhere first
- If you see a login page, respond with 'SESSION_INVALIDATED' immediately
- Take screenshots between major steps to track progress"""

⚠️ CRITICAL: SCREENSHOT HANDLING
- DO NOT press Alt+PrintScreen or any manual screenshot keys
- Screenshots are automatically taken by the system
- DO NOT attempt to take screenshots manually
- If you need to see the current state, just describe what you observe

🎯 STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH:

STEP 1 - VERIFY HOME TIMELINE:
You should already be on the home timeline due to pre-navigation
Look for the main timeline feed with tweets visible
If not on home timeline, press 'g+h' to navigate there

STEP 2 - ENSURE TOP POSITION:
Press 'Home' key to ensure you're at the top of the timeline
This prevents any scroll displacement issues
Wait 1 second for page to stabilize

   1. Read and note the text content of the currently focused tweet
   2. Ignore usernames, timestamps, interaction counts
   3. Focus ONLY on the main tweet text content
   4. If this is not the last tweet, press 'j' to move to next tweet
   5. CRITICAL: After pressing 'j', check if content is still visible
   6. If viewport shifted/content disappeared, execute recovery:
      - Press 'Home' key to return to top

🔧 CRITICAL: CONSOLIDATED VIEWPORT & NAVIGATION STRATEGY
This method combines the proven viewport stabilization fixes with robust individual page navigation to eliminate all displacement issues while providing reliable content extraction.

The browser viewport has been pre-stabilized and you are starting from a stable home timeline position.

{CUA_RESET_INSTRUCTIONS}

⚠️ CRITICAL: SCREENSHOT HANDLING
- DO NOT press Alt+PrintScreen or any manual screenshot keys
- Screenshots are automatically taken by the system
- DO NOT attempt to take screenshots manually
- If you need to see the current state, just describe what you observe

🎯 CONSOLIDATED STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH:

STEP 1 - VERIFY STABILIZED HOME TIMELINE:
You should already be on a pre-stabilized home timeline with tweets visible.
The viewport has been stabilized to prevent displacement during navigation.
Take a moment to confirm you can see the timeline with multiple tweets.

STEP 2 - ENSURE OPTIMAL STARTING POSITION:
Press 'Home' key to ensure you're at the very top of the timeline
This leverages the viewport stabilization and prevents scroll issues
Wait 1 second for page to fully stabilize

STEP 3 - CONSOLIDATED INDIVIDUAL PAGE NAVIGATION:
For each tweet from 1 to {num_tweets}:
   🧭 NAVIGATION SEQUENCE:
   1. Use 'j' to navigate to/focus on the target tweet
   2. VIEWPORT CHECK: If content shifts or becomes unavailable:
      - Press 'Home' key to return to top
      - Press 'g+h' to re-navigate to home timeline
      - Use 'j' key to return to current position
   3. Press 'Enter' to open the tweet's individual page
   4. Wait 2-3 seconds for the individual page to load and stabilize
   5. Extract the complete tweet text from the dedicated page
   6. Press 'g' then 'h' in sequence to return to home timeline
   7. Wait 1 second for timeline to reload and stabilize
   8. Continue to next tweet

STEP 4 - ENHANCED CONTENT EXTRACTION:
On each individual tweet page:
- Capture the full main tweet text content
- Include hashtags, mentions, and emoji characters
- Focus on the primary tweet text (ignore author names, timestamps, interaction counts)
- Ignore replies and quoted tweets unless they're part of the main content

STEP 5 - COMPILE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS:
Create a JSON array with all extracted tweet texts
Format: ["tweet1 text here", "tweet2 text here", "tweet3 text here"]

🔧 VIEWPORT RECOVERY PROTOCOL:
If at any point you notice content displacement or blank pages:
1. IMMEDIATELY press 'Home' key to return to page top
2. Wait 1 second for stabilization
3. Press 'g+h' to re-navigate to home timeline
4. Resume from current tweet position using 'j' navigation

NAVIGATION PATTERN EXAMPLE for 3 tweets:
Starting position → j → Enter → [extract on individual page] → g+h → j → j → Enter → [extract] → g+h → j → j → j → Enter → [extract]

RESPONSE FORMATS:
- 'SUCCESS: ["tweet1 text", "tweet2 text", "tweet3 text"]' (if all tweets extracted successfully)
- 'FAILED: Could not navigate to home timeline' (if initial navigation failed)
- 'FAILED: Could not navigate to individual tweet pages' (if Enter navigation failed)
- 'FAILED: Viewport displacement could not be recovered' (if stabilization failed)
- 'SESSION_INVALIDATED' (if login screen encountered)

This consolidated approach provides maximum reliability by combining viewport stabilization with individual page navigation for the most robust content extraction possible."""
