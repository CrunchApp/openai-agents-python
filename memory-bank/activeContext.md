Current pattern: Each CUA task starts a new browser → executes single task → closes browser
- Inefficient for workflows like "browse timeline and engage" 
- Requires multiple browser restarts for sequential operations
- Doesn't support fluid, human-like browsing patterns

#### **Solution: Stateful CUA Session Management**
New pattern: Start persistent browser session → execute multiple tasks sequentially → close when workflow complete
- Enables fluid "read timeline, then like tweet, then move to next" workflows
- Reduces resource overhead and improves performance
- Supports real-time interactive decision-making

*   **Error Recovery**: Robust cleanup on session initialization failures
*   **Session Information**: `get_session_info()` provides current state and browser details

#### **Usage Pattern**
```python
async with CuaSessionManager() as session:
    result1 = await session.run_task(task1)  # Browser stays open
    result2 = await session.run_task(task2)  # Same browser session
    # Automatic cleanup on exit
```

### ✅ Task 12.2: CuaWorkflowRunner Refactoring - COMPLETED

## Current Development Context: Phase 4 - Strategic Autonomy Consolidation

### ✅ Task 2.1: Consolidate Control and Simplify Scheduling - COMPLETED

**Achievement**: Successfully eliminated conflicting schedulers that were causing API rate limit errors and competing for resources.

#### **Scheduling Architecture Consolidation**
*   **✅ Removed Separate Mention Processing**: Eliminated `schedule_mention_processing()` from SchedulingAgent
*   **✅ Removed Separate Reply Processing**: Eliminated `schedule_approved_reply_processing()` from SchedulingAgent  
*   **✅ Consolidated Entry Point**: Updated `run_autonomous_agent.py` to schedule only the autonomous cycle
*   **✅ Single Decision Maker**: OrchestratorAgent now has sole authority over when to check mentions or process replies
*   **✅ Rate Limit Resolution**: Eliminated conflicting API calls that were causing 429 errors

#### **Technical Implementation**
**Modified Files:**
*   **`run_autonomous_agent.py`**: Removed calls to mention and reply processing schedulers
*   **`project_agents/scheduling_agent.py`**: Deleted `schedule_mention_processing()` and `schedule_approved_reply_processing()` methods, and related job functions

**Operational Benefits:**
*   **API Rate Limit Prevention**: No more conflicting processes hitting X API simultaneously
*   **Strategic Centralization**: OrchestratorAgent makes all timing decisions based on strategic assessment
*   **Simplified Architecture**: Clean, single-threaded autonomous operation
*   **Enhanced Reliability**: Eliminates resource contention and scheduling conflicts

#### **Next Strategic Phase**
The OrchestratorAgent now operates as the sole strategic decision-maker, setting the foundation for enhanced autonomous intelligence where timing, priorities, and actions are all driven by strategic assessment rather than rigid scheduling.
