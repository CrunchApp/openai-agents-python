# Project Progress: Autonomous X Agentic Unit

## 1. Overall Roadmap Status

*   **Current Phase**: **Phase 2: Expanding Interactions (Replies, DMs, Basic Analysis & Scheduling)**
*   **Completed Milestones (Phase 1: Foundation and Core Posting Agent - MVP)**:
    *   Project Inception & Initial Planning completed.
    *   OpenAI Agents SDK successfully forked and development environment established (Python 3.9.x, venv, core dependencies).
    *   Comprehensive Cursor rules and memory bank documentation suite created.
    *   Core configuration module (`core/config.py`) implemented using Pydantic for settings management from `.env` files.
    *   Database manager (`core/db_manager.py`) implemented for SQLite, including schema initialization for `x_oauth_tokens`, `task_queue`, `agent_state`, and `human_review_queue` tables.
    *   OAuth token manager (`core/oauth_manager.py`) completed, featuring Fernet encryption/decryption, storage, retrieval, and refresh logic for X API OAuth 2.0 PKCE tokens (public client configuration).
    *   X API interaction tool (`tools/x_api_tools.py`) for posting text tweets (`post_text_tweet`) successfully implemented using direct `requests` calls and `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, bypassing initial Tweepy issues. Custom `XApiError` defined.
    *   Basic agent structures (`agents/x_interaction_agent.py`, `agents/orchestrator_agent.py`) and `main.py` entry point created, demonstrating a successful end-to-end workflow for posting a tweet.
    *   `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warnings resolved project-wide using timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`.
    *   Unit tests implemented for `core/config.py`, `core/oauth_manager.py`, `tools/x_api_tools.py`, and basic agent classes, achieving good foundational test coverage.
    *   Successfully posted a test tweet to X, validating the core MVP functionality.
*   **Upcoming Major Milestones (During Phase 2 - Next 1-2 Months)**:
    *   Implement functionality to read X account mentions.
    *   Develop `ContentCreationAgent` for drafting replies to mentions.
    *   Implement basic Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) workflow for reply approval.
    *   Integrate APScheduler for basic scheduled tasks (e.g., periodic mention checking).
    *   Develop tools for sending and receiving Direct Messages (pending X API v2 DM endpoint research).
    *   Basic analysis capabilities (e.g., mention counting).

## 2. Current Sprint Goals (Phase 2, Sprint 1 - e.g., Next 2 Weeks)

*   **Primary Goal**: Enable the agent to retrieve X mentions and prepare for reply generation.
*   **Key Tasks**:
    1.  Update `core/db_manager.py`:
        *   Ensure `agent_state` table is suitable for storing `last_processed_mention_id`.
        *   Implement `save_agent_state(key, value)` and `get_agent_state(key)` functions.
    2.  Develop X API tool `get_mentions(since_id: Optional[str] = None)` in `tools/x_api_tools.py` to fetch mentions for the authenticated user, including relevant tweet/user fields and handling `since_id` parameter.
    3.  (Stretch Goal for Sprint 1) Begin design and implementation of `ContentCreationAgent` with a method to receive mention data and draft a preliminary reply using an LLM.
    4.  Write unit tests for new DB manager functions and the `get_mentions` tool.

## 3. Known Impediments & Blockers (Current)

*   **X API v2 DM Endpoints**: Detailed capabilities and best practices for using X API v2 for Direct Messages need thorough research before implementation. Access levels and rate limits are key concerns.
*   **X API v2 Media Uploads**: Still needs research for robust media (image/video) uploading for tweets (relevant for later in Phase 2 or Phase 3).
*   **CUA Environment Setup**: Specifics for the controlled CUA execution environment (Docker, browser versions, Playwright) need to be finalized before Phase 3 CUA development.
*   **(Resolved/Mitigated for Posting)** X Developer Account & App Setup: App is set up and basic posting works. Ongoing monitoring of API access tier capabilities is needed.

## 4. High-Level Backlog Overview (Remainder of Phase 2 & Glimpse of Phase 3)

*   **Phase 2 Remainder**:
    *   Full implementation and testing of `ContentCreationAgent`.
    *   Development of `HumanHandoffTool` and integration into the reply workflow (using `human_review_queue` table).
    *   Design and implement `SchedulingAgent` and `core/scheduler_setup.py` for APScheduler integration; schedule periodic mention checks.
    *   Implement X API tools for sending and (if feasible) receiving DMs.
    *   Implement basic `AnalysisAgent` tasks (e.g., mention sentiment if time allows).
*   **Early Phase 3 Considerations (after robust Phase 2 completion)**:
    *   Begin PoC for OpenAI "Computer Use" tool: simple UI navigation and data extraction from X.
    *   Implement X API tools for posting tweets with media (if API is viable) or plan CUA approach.
    *   Implement X API tools for creating polls.
