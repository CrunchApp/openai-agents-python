# Project Progress: Autonomous X Agentic Unit

## 1. Overall Roadmap Status

*   **Current Phase**: Phase 1: Foundation and Core Posting Agent (MVP)
*   **Completed Milestones (Conceptual - As of Project Start)**:
    *   Project Inception & Initial Planning.
    *   Forking of OpenAI Agents SDK.
    *   Initial setup of development environment (Python, venv, core dependencies).
    *   Creation of this initial set of Cursor rules and memory bank documentation.
*   **Upcoming Major Milestones (Next 1-2 Months)**:
    *   Successful X API v2 OAuth 2.0 PKCE authentication and token management.
    *   Deployment of a basic `OrchestratorAgent` and `XInteractionAgent`.
    *   First successful automated post of a text-only tweet to a test X account using an API-based tool.
    *   Basic logging framework operational.
    *   Initial SQLite database schema for `x_oauth_tokens` and `task_queue` implemented and tested.

## 2. Current Sprint Goals (Sprint 1 - e.g., Next 2 Weeks)

*   **Primary Goal**: Achieve basic, authenticated X API v2 "post tweet" functionality.
*   **Key Tasks**:
    1.  Implement X API OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow utility script for initial token acquisition.
    2.  Develop `core/oauth_manager.py` to securely store, retrieve, and refresh X API tokens using SQLite.
    3.  Implement `core/config.py` to load X API credentials and OpenAI API key from `.env`.
    4.  Develop the first X API tool: `post_text_tweet(text: str)` in `tools/x_api_tools.py` using Tweepy.
    5.  Define basic `OrchestratorAgent` and `XInteractionAgent` in `agents/` capable of invoking the `post_text_tweet` tool.
    6.  Create `main.py` entry point to initialize and run a simple "post a test tweet" workflow.
    7.  Implement foundational structured logging to console and `data/app.log`.
    8.  Write unit tests for `core/oauth_manager.py` and `tools/x_api_tools.py:post_text_tweet`.

## 3. Known Impediments & Blockers (Current)

*   **X Developer Account & App Setup**: Access to an X Developer Portal account with an approved application (App ID, API Key, API Secret) for the appropriate access tier (e.g., Basic or Pro, Free for initial testing if sufficient) is pending/in progress. This is critical for any X API interaction.
*   **Clarity on X API v2 Media Uploads**: Detailed steps and confirmed working examples for X API v2 media upload (for images/videos in tweets) using Tweepy or `requests` need to be thoroughly researched for Phase 3. The documentation can sometimes be ambiguous.
*   **CUA Environment Setup**: The specifics of the controlled environment for OpenAI's "Computer Use" tool (e.g., Docker image with specific browser, Playwright setup, display resolution) need to be finalized before active CUA development in Phase 3.

## 4. High-Level Backlog Overview (Next 1-2 Sprints after current)

*   **Phase 2 Focus**: Expanding X Interactions & Basic Scheduling.
    *   Implement tools for reading mentions, replying to tweets (with initial HIL for replies).
    *   Implement tools for sending/receiving DMs (research v2 DM endpoints thoroughly).
    *   Integrate APScheduler for basic scheduled tasks (e.g., checking for new mentions).
    *   Develop `ContentCreationAgent` for drafting replies.
    *   Expand SQLite schema for tracking processed items (mentions, DMs).
*   **Early Phase 3 Considerations**:
    *   Begin PoC for "Computer Use" tool: simple navigation and screenshot task on X.
    *   Implement X API tools for posting tweets with media and creating polls.
